#### Description
Include neural net models here.

Class naming convention should be: Net_{fill with high-level order of the model }  
E.g., Net_3C_XL_A_K_F.py

Where:
- 3C = 3 CNN layers  
- XL = user-defined (X) number of LSTM layers  
- A = Attention layer  
- K = Concat layer  
- S = Sum layer (e.g., for summing instead of concating after attention)  
- F = FC layer
